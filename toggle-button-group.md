- Steps:
    1. Render the ToggleButtonGroup component with multiple ToggleButtons and the multi property set to false.
    2. Click on multiple buttons.
    3. Check the selected state of each button.

- Steps:
1. Render the ToggleButtonGroup component with multiple ToggleButtons and the multi property set to true.
2. Click on multiple buttons.
3. Check the selected state of each button.
